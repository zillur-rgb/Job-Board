## Overview

The task wis to create a simple Job Application portal.

### The challenges

- The challenge was to make Backend Frontend and also Database where I can do CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation.
- For frontend challenging part was to create functioning authentication system.
- Besides there are a lot of routes I need to work with and sometimes it was challenging to maintain.
- But overall it was a fun project. I really enjoyed.

### How it works

- User can click on any job to learn more about the job.
- User can search for the job with different filters.
